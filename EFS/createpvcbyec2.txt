STEPS TO INSTALL KUBERNETES CLUSTER WITH PERSISTENT VOLUME ON EC2 INSTANCE
____________________________________

step1)create All setup cluste and node.
2) create new instance with EFS label.
3) Install nfs-server on it to connect on # $ apt install nfs-kernel-server -y
4) create directory to share with client and also change permission 
   #  sudo mkdir -p /mnt/nfs_share
   #  sudo chmod 777 /mnt/nfs_share         # change file permission
   #  sudo chown -R nobody:nogroup /mnt/nfs_share
 
5) to access this folder need to export from export file  # sudo nano /etc/exports
    add at bottom line   #  /mnt/nfs_share *(rw,sync,no_subtree_check,no_root_squash)               #----* indicates all ip you can change by your ip
  now retstart this file    
                         # sudo exportfs -a     &  
                         # sudo systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server
6)  Add nfs port security in security group with all ip open

7) go to server create deployment/replication controller with volume mount option 
    volumes:
    - name: volname
      nfs:
        server:  170.0.0.1
        path:    /mnt/nfs_server             #find and change this two field according you ip and ec2 path

8)Again install step 3) on cluster server and worker node  ---
9) create pvc in deployment file # if already leave it      
for manual pvcclass can refer             
---
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
  metadata:
    name: MYAPP                                              
    namespace: default      					
    labels:       						
      app: MYAPP						 
  spec: 							
    storageClassName: yourstorageclass          
    accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 2Gi
---

# this is manually create class name with file storageclass and check with
# kubectl get storageclass
#  pvc can map with pv only on 2 condition  
1)  exact volume match  2) type of volume RWO/RWE/ROX
# pvc in deploy pod must be same name with pvc metadata:name

error:-----  #kubectl get pvc -n <namespace>   # check pvc is pending there  
             # kubectl get pod -n <ns>        -------copy pod name
             # describe pod if pending    # kubectl describe pod <podname> -n <ns>
  1)   volume binding error 
         go to unbound immediate pvc    means  pv not attach with host/server
        # kubectl get pv   # check is there storage class congi in server     also check in deploy => pvc code  is there storageclass = default


now create manually pv -#########------------------------------

create new file with storage.class   # mkdir storage.class
---
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: PersistentVolume
  metadata:
    name: myvolume
    namespace: default      					
    labels:       						
      app: MYAPP						 
  spec: 							
    storageClassName: yourstorageclass          
    accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 2Gi
    nfs:
       server: 170.0.0.
       path: mnt/nfs_server

run # kubectl apply -f storage.class                 # pv no need to namespace 
check storage # kubectl get storageclass


**** rmember   ---if service/pod/deployment delete pvc will not delete and also depend on type of storage delete/recycle/retain 
               --- if delete pv also pvc delete         
to check pod and pvc connect or not run application and check files from nfs-ec2 instance at location # cd /mnt/nfs_share
